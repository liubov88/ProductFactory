//better to declare class separately.. and use nsmespase without {} it is ok to use ; at the end of namespace in .net6

//Just to add something... If you don't put {get; set;} you are creating a Field but if you put the {get; set;} you are creating a Property. Having a property could make some things easier especially when working with Reflection.

//this question ou asked me.. and here is a responce.. >> Reflection provides objects (of type Type) that describe assemblies, modules, and types. You can use reflection to dynamically create an instance of a type, bind the type to an existing object, or get the type from an existing object and invoke its methods or access its fields and properties. If you are using attributes in your code, reflection enables you to access them

// i added int? since i saw it is not obligatory... ex. new Product { ProductName = "Orange Juice", ProductType = "AllDay" },

namespace ProductFactory;
public class Product
{
  public string ProductName { get; set; }
  public string ProductType { get; set; }
  public int? StartHour { get; set; }
  public int? EndHour { get; set; }
}
